# Project Fremen

Project Fremen is the working repo for building the Unigentamos internal admin system.

This repository currently contains:

1. A decision-complete operating plan aligned to your Obsidian methodology.
2. A 10-day MVP execution path.
3. A starter dashboard scaffold (Next.js) for immediate implementation.

## Key Constraints (Locked)

1. Obsidian remains property-first, not folder-first.
2. `nav_north` and `nav_south` are only for directly spawned note relationships.
3. `Project Fremen`, `Project Iceflake`, and `Project Pint` are separate projects, not parent-child in Obsidian properties.
4. Business hierarchy (Unigentamos above brands) is modeled in the website/database layer, not forced into Obsidian note hierarchy.

## Start Here

1. Read `docs/01-Updated-Operating-Plan.md`.
2. Run the Day 0 checklist in `docs/02-Execution-Checklist-Day0-Day2.md`.
3. Use `dashboard/` as the MVP admin app starting point.
4. Run `docs/06-Weekly-Review.md` once per week.
5. Run `docs/07-Monthly-Review.md` once per month.
6. Keep KPI meaning stable with `docs/08-KPI-Definitions.md`.
7. Use `docs/09-Deployment-Runbook.md` for production deployment steps.
8. Use `docs/10-Release-Checklist.md` before each release.
9. Use `docs/11-Auth-Hardening.md` for current security controls and limits.
10. Use `docs/12-KPI-External-Integration-Sentry.md` for first external KPI connector setup.
11. Use `docs/13-Obsidian-Export-Strategy.md` for planned export design.
12. Use `docs/14-Obsidian-Export-Runbook.md` for implemented export operations.
