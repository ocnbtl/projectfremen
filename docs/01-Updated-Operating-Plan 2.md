# Updated Operating Plan (Simple + Complete)

## What Changed Based on Your Notes

1. Removed the Obsidian parent-child mapping between `Project Fremen`, `Project Iceflake`, and `Project Pint`.
2. Preserved your strict meaning of `nav_north` / `nav_south`: only direct spawned-note relationships.
3. Kept project identities separate in Obsidian:
   - `Project Fremen` (Unigentamos workstream)
   - `Project Iceflake` (pngwn workstream)
   - `Project Pint` (Ranosa Decor workstream)
4. Moved parent-company hierarchy to the web admin data model (not vault note hierarchy).

## Operating Model (Simple)

1. Obsidian + GitHub are source of truth for written docs.
2. Unigentamos dashboard is the execution surface:
   - action center
   - KPI monitoring
   - calendar and reminders
   - central docs search/filter
3. Weekly workflow is guided by the dashboard, not memory.

## Business Coverage Areas

Each area must have owner, status, next review date, and evidence/doc link.

1. Company and entity structure.
2. Legal and compliance tracking.
3. Finance and monthly close.
4. Tax readiness.
5. Brand oversight (pngwn / Ranosa Decor).
6. KPI tracking.
7. Risk and issue log.
8. Decisions and rationale log.
9. Vendor and contract tracking.
10. IP and brand assets.
11. Security and access.
12. Future project onboarding template.

## Data Boundary Rules

1. Obsidian metadata remains unchanged and authoritative.
2. Dashboard consumes metadata and presents operational views.
3. Dashboard does not redefine your property vocabulary.
4. Brand/project docs remain separate, with cross-links only where helpful.

## MVP Scope (10 Days)

1. Founder login.
2. Action center for tasks/reviews.
3. Project/brand overview cards.
4. KPI manual input and snapshot.
5. Calendar of upcoming reviews and deadlines.
6. GitHub doc index with search and filters.

## What We Are Not Doing in MVP

1. Full role-based auth.
2. Automated KPI API integrations.
3. Complex workflow engines.
4. Rewriting your Obsidian system.
