# Weekly Review

Use this once per week (recommended: Sunday).

Goal: keep Unigentamos, pngwn, and Diyesu Decor clear, updated, and unblocked.

Target duration: under 30 minutes.

## Who Updates What

Use one owner value for each KPI or task:

1. `Me`
2. `AI Agent`
3. `Auto`

If owner is `AI Agent` or `Auto`, still do a quick manual spot-check.
